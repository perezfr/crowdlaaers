            Welcome to the “Crowd Layers” dashboard, a public service for ​Capturing and Reporting Open Web Data for Learning Analytics, Annotation, and Education Researchers ​(CROWDLAAERS). This real-time dashboard visualizes group – or ​crowd​ – discourse ​layers​ added via Hypothesis open web annotation to online documents.
            <br>
            <br>
            Developed by researchers at the University of Colorado Denver, CROWDLAAERS visualizes social learning analytics associated with open and collaborative web annotation. The dashboard has been iteratively designed in partnership with educators and researchers to support the social life of reading and the social life of documents across the open and annotated web.

            <hr class="my-4">

            Use the CROWDLAAERS dashboard to <b><i>Search</b></i> or for <b><i>Groups</b></i>.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Search:</b> Explore the social learning analytics associated with a single annotated document. Search by entering the URL of a webpage, PDF, or ePub that features Hypothesis annotation. CROWDLAAERS also generates a public link to share real-time analytics specific to a URL.
            <br>
            <img src="https://crowdlaaers.org/img/search_URL.gif" class="img-fluid m-4" alt="Search URL"> 
            <br>
            <b>Share:</b>
            <br>
            <img src="https://crowdlaaers.org/img/share_URL.gif" class="img-fluid m-4" alt="Share URL"> 
            <br>
            <b>Groups:</b> Explore all the social learning analytics for multiple documents annotated by members of a Hypothesis group. Add your personal API developer token to CROWDLAAERS and access private group activity for both a single document and all the documents annotated by a private group.
            <br>
            <img src="https://crowdlaaers.org/img/gettoken.gif" class="img-fluid m-4" alt="Search groups">
            <br>
            Whether using CROWDLAAERS to <b><i>Search</b></i> a single annotated document or to examine the collaborative activity of <b><i>Groups</b></i> across multiple annotated documents, the dashboard features multiple graphs that report social learning analytics about:
            <ul class="mt-2">
              <li>Annotations</li>
              <li>Participants</li>
              <li>Documents</li>
              <li>Threads</li>
              <li>Days</li>
              <li>Tags</li>
            </ul>
            Each graph is interactive and also responsive. Selecting data within one graph will automatically filter corresponding analytics in all the other graphs. Click the circular arrows near the Annotations graph to reset your <b><i>Search</b></i> or <b><i>Groups</b></i> activity.
            <hr class="my-4">
            CROWDLAAERS demonstrates how open web annotation data can be transparently leveraged as social learning analytics. Researchers interested in studying open web annotation and social learning analytics are very welcome to use the CROWDLAAERS dashboard to support their inquiry and scholarship. Educators interested in supporting students’ use of open web annotation for collaborative learning are very welcome to use the CROWDLAAERS dashboard to support their teaching and learning practices. If you are interested in learning more about the technical features of CROWDLAAERS, please contact our research team at <a href="mailto: info@crowdlaaers.org">info@crowdlaaers.org</a>.

            CROWDLAAERS has been developed, and is currently administered, by University of Colorado Denver researchers Francisco Perez and Remi Kalir. While we partner with Hypothesis on various education and research projects, we are not Hypothesis employees and do not represent the organization. We sincerely appreciate Hypothesis’ encouragement and support in developing this public dashboard. Furthermore, we cannot guarantee that CROWDLAAERS will not be buggy. This is an experimental and academic project, not a commercial product. We welcome your feedback and appreciate your patience as we improve this public service. Please email us at <a href="mailto: info@crowdlaaers.org">info@crowdlaaers.org</a> with any queries.
